> Again glad to hear that this is a satisfactory solution for less than ideal real-world situations.
 
>As for posting on StackOverflow that’s acceptable because DTS shouldn’t be sending you any information, confidential or otherwise, that isn’t fit for public consumption. As you mention, it may help someone else which ultimately means fewer support incidents. My personal preference is that my name not be used but again this isn’t much cause for concern if it had been.

>Excellent news on pixel format conversion performance!

> The details of the implementation are helpful as well but in terms of sharing sample code DTS isn’t in a position to do that in this situation (sample code sent to DTS is for support incidents only), and I apologize for asking previously. My mistake there was not considering the full legal ramifications which would decidedly not be in your favor. The same goes for the Metal team and collaboration on OpenSource projects. DTS will on the other hand happily support such a project via support requests. Hope that makes sense and if you need further clarification don’t hesitate to ask.
